 * ptrs watches for pointer usage in the component.
 * Conditional usage is no problem, unlike with usePointer (can't be used in ifs, like any other hook).
 * The component will re-render if the component used a pointer's value during rendering, that now changed.
 * It only watches for itself, not for pointer usage in its children.
 * 
 * Conditional rendering works like:
 * ```
 * if (pointerA()) {
 *   console.log(pointerB()); // change of pointerB will only re-render if pointerA was truthy
 * }
 * ```
 * @param component The component to watch
 * @returns A wrapped component that behaves like the original component, but watches for pointer usage.
